This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the backend:

```bash
cd src/api
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

### Notes:

- The backend is running on port 8000 by default.
- The frontend is running on port 3000 by default.
- The backend is coded using Python 3 so ensure you have it installed.
